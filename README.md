# MARKET-REGIME-PREDICTOR
A model which predicts future regime of a particular stock and advices user whether to buy a particular stock or not in the upcoming trading phase
## The primary goal of this project is to classify the stock market into three 
regimes based on historical data and predict future regimes. Accurately 
identifying these regimes is crucial as they provide insight into the market’s 
current behaviour and likely future trends, enabling more informed decision
making. 
The regimes are defined as: 
• Bull: An upward trending market, characterized by consistent increases in 
stock prices. This phase often signals investor optimism and is associated with 
economic growth. It’s a favourable environment for investors aiming for 
capital gains. 
• Bear: A downward trending market, marked by significant declines in stock 
prices. This phase reflects pessimism among investors, often linked to 
economic slowdowns or crises. Understanding bear markets allows 
stakeholders to mitigate risks and develop strategies for preservation. 
• Sideways: A relatively stable market with no significant trend in either 
direction. This phase indicates market indecision or balance between supply 
and demand. Identifying sideways markets helps investors avoid 
unproductive trades and focus on long-term opportunities.
